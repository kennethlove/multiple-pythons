# Notes

- This feature will install `asdf` as the devcontainer `remoteUser`. It will also
configure profiles and autocompletions for each of the following shells:
  - bash
  - zsh
  - fish
- The latest Python version provided in the `versions` list will be set as the
global version in `asdf` by default. The user can change this afterwards.

# Credits

This feature is heavily borrowed from ["Hypermodern Python"](https://github.com/natescherer/devcontainers-custom-features).
